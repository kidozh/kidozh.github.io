                        Upsampling and Convolutional layer constitute transpose convolutional layer to generate hierarchy signal blueprint.
                        By competition between discriminator and generator, it's easy to re-create realistic signal.

                    <p class="paragraph">Since the data is obtained by unsupervised approach, the final result could be not stable.
                    In addition, because the optimization point is located at one saddle point of G-D tensor space, it make optimization
                        even harder.

                        Key to simplify model's design is to using end-to-end architecture. The hybrid of generative and discriminative network

                        Fed with high-dimensional random noise, GAN can give diverse signal sample which is hard for machine to recognize validity.
                        By progressive deep-learning training, generative network is able to evolve itself. A remarkable signal could be obtained after
                        proper epoch of deep learning training.

                        There is no requirement for distribution of original data. It enable the widespread use of GAN in general circumstances. The
                        only thing GAN need to do is clone the siblings of signal data. By introducing lantent space parameter(z), GAN can generate the
                        corresponding signal. It could help us to reinforce data, diagnose failure and optimize the best machining parameters by searching
                        z tensor space. It can be the fundamental ground research which enable network to handle realtime machining just like AlphaGo.

                    <p>GAN training implements game theory that makes G and D network compete to exploit their performance.
                    Generative network(G) tries to generate realistic signal to deceive discriminative network(D). D tries to
                        identify the validity of given signal. Finally, both network achieve <strong>nash balance</strong> which means discriminator
                        fails to recognize signal and generator can give sequence whose data distribution is the same as original sample.

                    <p>
                        Since the limit of sample's size and optimization's location, training of GAN is hard. Also, because range in every dimension is
                        different, the compound tensor may not be so accurate. But the tendency shows that GAN can clone data well.

                    <p>
                        The core of discriminator is classical post-activation design. By MLP architecture, discriminator can extract
                        features of machining signal at every abstract level.

                    <p>
                        The discriminator is fed with signal which may comes from real data and fake data generated by G-network. This
                        network will output a binary value recognizing validity of given sequence. Trained with Adam optimization
                        (learning rate 0.0001 and \( beta_1 \) 0.5), the discriminator will adapt itself to identify signal.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="title">Loss function</h3>
                    <p>The loss function is binary crossentropy which is used for binary recognition.</p>
                    <p>
                        $$  loss = -\sum_{i=1}^{n}\hat{y_i}logy_i+(1-\hat{y_i})log(1-y_i)\\ \frac {\partial loss} {\partial y} = -\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac {\hat{y_i}} {y_i}-\frac {1-\hat{y_i}} {1-y_i} $$
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="title">Technical Tricks</h3>
                    <p> In order to prevent sparse features, <strong>leaky rectified linear unit</strong>(LeakyRelu) activation is used.
                        In practical training of GAN, discriminator can always easily recognize whether given signal is true or fake. In order
                        to make competition stable, dropout layer with fair large dropout rate is applied. Because of prior success in monitoring
                        realtime tool wear, a descending dimension is implement in convolutional layer.
